## :globe_with_meridians: NeoNephos?

NeoNephos supports Europe’s strategic goal of creating a sovereign cloud-to-edge continuum — a federated digital platform spanning multiple providers, infrastructures, and software ecosystems. Emerging from the EU IPCEI-CIS initiative and building on the foundations laid by the ApeiroRA project, NeoNephos marks a strong step forward in our joint commitment to digital sovereignty — enabling openness, resilience, and innovation through collaboration and shared governance.

The NeoNephos Foundation is part of the Linux Foundation Europe.
