# Technical Advisory Council

NeoNephos' governance is split between the [membership driven organisational governance through the Governing Board (GB)](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md)
and the open access technical governance through the Technical Advisory Council (TAC).

The TAC ensures the projects adhere to the NeoNephos vision and acts as an interface between the projects and the [Governing Board](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md).

The specific responsibilities are set in the [NeoNephos Charter](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.b399ecdf5f859a9f55ff3dc8bf8218d5.1748238689615.1750404125102.1750409856266.57&__hssc=81619592.1.1750409856266&__hsfp=2785804087), but they include

- Technical oversight of the technical projects.
- Liaison between the technical projects and the GB.
- Requesting foundational resources like infrastructure, event planning support or funding from the GB.
- Deciding on new technical projects (with GB)
- Establishing technical guidelines like [project lifecycles](placeholder)
- Establishing community norms.

## TAC Composition

The TAC is composed as a mixture of [sponsorship based representation](../misc/membership_introduction.md) and open-to-all-merit-based representation. The following roles are the minimum roles for a functioning TAC.

### Premier Representative

The Premier Representatives represent the interest of their respective [Premier Sponsor](../misc/membership_introduction.md). 

### Technical Project Representative

Each technical project has a representative in the TAC. This is usually the Chairperson of the [Technical Steering Committee](../technical_steering_committee/technical_steering_committee_introduction.md) but may also be another delegate.

### Chairperson

The Chairperson leads the meetings, sets the agenda and decides on day-to-day operational decisions. In addition, the chair also functions as *TAC Representative* on the [Governing Board](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md).
