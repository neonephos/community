# Sponsors

NeoNephos' governance is split between the membership driven organisational governance by the [Governing Board (GB)](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md)
and the open access technical governance advanced by the [Technical Advisory Council (TAC)](../technical_advisory_council/technical_advisory_council_introduction.md).

While the technical governance is open to anyone, the organizational governance is usually driven by, perhaps non-surprisingly, organizations. In order to participate in the organizational governance, it is a requirement to be a member of a sponsorship class, which is facilitated by choosing one of the NeoNephos' sponsorship levels.

Note: The following is an overview. Please consult the [NeoNephos Project Charter](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.b399ecdf5f859a9f55ff3dc8bf8218d5.1748238689615.1750928571631.1750956925388.76&__hssc=81619592.1.1750956925388&__hsfp=1765797706) for the exact rulework pertaining to membership levels.

## Membership Levels

### Premier Member

Premier Members are the most fully-featured position in NeoNephos. Organizations choosing this membership level have a guaranteed seat (with voting rights) in all important committees, like the [Governing Board](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md), the [Technical Advisory Council](../technical_advisory_council/technical_advisory_council_introduction.md) or other subcommittees.

Premier Sponsorship is most suited for organizations intending to actively participate and drive NeoNephos' agenda.

### General Member

General Sponsorship is a more affordable option to the Premier Membership. In exchange for a more affordable sponsorship fee the organization's representation in some committees, such as the Governing Board is shared with other General Members.

General Sponsorship allows smaller organizations to participate in the organizational leadership of NeoNephos and collectively have their voice heard. 

### Associate Member

The Associate Memberhip is a free tier for qualifying organizations to join the foundation. Associate Membership does not confer any voting rights in any committee. 

Associate Membership is rare and usually only non-profits or universities are elligible.
