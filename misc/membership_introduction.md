# Members

While participation in the technical governance is open to anyone via the [Technical Advisory Council (TAC)](../technical_advisory_council/technical_advisory_council_introduction.md) and Technical Steering Committees (TSCs) of the projects, the [strategic governance](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md) is driven by NeoNephos' members. In order to participate in the organizational governance, it is a requirement to be a member of a membership class, which is facilitated by choosing one of the NeoNephos' membership levels below.

Note: The following is an overview. Please consult the [NeoNephos Project Charter](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.b399ecdf5f859a9f55ff3dc8bf8218d5.1748238689615.1750928571631.1750956925388.76&__hssc=81619592.1.1750956925388&__hsfp=1765797706) for the exact rulework pertaining to membership levels. Please note that to become a member, [the organization must already be a member of the Linux Foundation Europe](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.11739e1f4ca03192f4e918409f725053.1748961872693.1755169332458.1755604645613.29&__hssc=81619592.2.1755604645613&__hsfp=1879682750).

## Membership Levels

### Premier Member

Organizations choosing this membership level have a guaranteed seat (with voting rights) in all important committees, like the [Governing Board](../governing_board/governing_board_introduction.md), the [Technical Advisory Council](../technical_advisory_council/technical_advisory_council_introduction.md) or other subcommittees.

Premier Membership is most suited for organizations intending to actively participate and drive NeoNephos' agenda.

### General Member

General Membership is a more accessible option to the Premier Membership. In exchange for a more affordable membership fee the organization's representation in some committees, such as the Governing Board is either shared with other General Members or limited to an observational role (as in the TAC).

General Membership allows smaller organizations to participate in the organizational leadership of NeoNephos and collectively have their voice heard. 

### Associate Member

The Associate Memberhip is a free tier for qualifying organizations to join the foundation. Associate Membership does not confer any voting rights in any committee. 

Associate Membership is rare and usually only non-profits or universities are elligible.
