# NeoNephos? IPCEI-CIS? 8ra?

Presentations of NeoNephos are often accompanied by a plethora of terms and abbreviations such as IPCEI-CIS, 8ra, CISERO and Multi-Provider-Cloud-Edge-Continuum. But what do they mean? This blog post aims to give you a high-level understanding on how NeoNephos relates and fits into that bigger picture.

## What is an IPCEI?

To understand an IPCEI let's go back to the basics. The European Union (EU) is a supranational organization where member states have conferred aspects of their national sovereignty to EU institutions. This allows these institutional bodies to make decisions and binding laws, under the motive of strengthening the functioning of the union. One particular area of interest is the distribution of state aid. Such subventions to e.g. the private sector have the power to distort the market in favor of a member state and must therefore be regulated supranationally, at the level of the union as a whole. 

[Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12008E107) defines a list of exceptions on when state aid is allowed and can be disbursed by a national government to its internal market. For the purposes of NeoNephos, of particular interest is section three, which states:

>3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market:
>[..]
>**(b) aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State;**
>[..]

This means that initiatives held under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) umbrella are eligible for state aid. Subsidies are usually distributed by the national government's economic ministries, such as the [BMWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_for_Economic_Affairs_and_Energy) in Germany. To be considered an IPCEI, [the initiative must represent a very important contribution to economic growth, jobs and competitiveness for the Union industry and economy in view of their positive spillover effects on the internal market and the Union society.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52014XC0620%2801%29)

Thus far, over [11 IPCEIs have been approved](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei/approved-ipceis_en), relating to a wide range of diverse areas such as Microelectronics, Batteries and Health Care.

On 5 December 2023 the European Commission [approved the IPCEI Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services (IPCEI-CIS)](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei/approved-ipceis/cloud_en). It is the first IPCEI in the cloud and edge computing domain. It concerns the development of the first interoperable and openly accessible European data processing ecosystem, the multi-provider cloud to edge continuum. The full details are available [here](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei/approved-ipceis/cloud_en). SAP contributes to IPCEI-CIS via the [Apeiro Reference Architecture (ApeiroRA)](https://apeirora.eu). As described in more detail in our [brief history of NeoNephos blogpost](https://github.com/neonephos/community/blob/main/misc/neonephos_intro.md), the open-source NeoNephos Foundation is a consequence of the required spillover effects of an IPCEI.

## What is 8ra?

In [its own words](https://www.8ra.com/wp-content/uploads/8ra_Supervisory-Board_Mission-Document.pdf), 8ra (pronounced *ora*), is the trademark of an initiative with the stated goal of establishing a true Multi Provider Cloud Edge Continuum in Europe. In practice, this means it is disseminating the results of the IPCEI-CIS to the whole EU business ecosystem. Currently, all of 8ra's projects originate from IPCEI-CIS but it is possible that over time projects from other initiatives with similar scope may join. The 8ra initiative is set up for the long term [even beyond the conclusion of the underlying IPCEI-CIS](https://www.8ra.com/wp-content/uploads/8ra_Supervisory-Board_Mission-Document.pdf).

## What is CISERO?

[The Cloud Infrastructure Services and Exploitation Resources Office (CISERO)](https://cisero-project.eu/) is a 36-month initiative funded by the EU's [Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme). It is led by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and was kickstarted in 2024 in Berlin. In contrast to 8ra, it is time limited and exclusively concerned with the dissemination of IPCEI-CIS results. CISERO internally packages its efforts into [five workstreams](https://cisero-project.eu/about-us), which are all concerned to varying degrees with focus areas such as Community Building, Governance Support, Communication, Dissemination, and Exploitation. 

## How NeoNephos relates to these initiatives?

It is commonly asked how independent NeoNephos is from the aforementioned organizational entities. The answer is straightforward: **The NeoNephos Foundation is a project of the Linux Foundation Europe (LFEU).** The foundation itself, all its projects, trademarks and domains are fully owned by LFEU. 
The link to IPCEI-CIS can be found [in our mission statement](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.11739e1f4ca03192f4e918409f725053.1748961872693.1755169332458.1755604645613.29&__hssc=81619592.2.1755604645613&__hsfp=1879682750):

> The NeoNephos Foundation is dedicated to advancing open-source projects that align with the strategic objectives of the European Union's Important Project of Common European Interest in Cloud Infrastructure and Services (EU IPCEI-CIS).

IPCEI-CIS jumpstarted the development of the initial batch of NeoNephos projects by providing funding to ApeiroRA and provides the ideology behind NeoNephos.

Still, contributors, projects and members which had nothing to do with the initial IPCEI-CIS but align to its philosophy are free to contribute to NeoNephos. NeoNephos does not receive direct funding from the IPCEI budget.

Our relationship with IPCEI-CIS through ApeiroRA is a great benefit as the entire foundation benefits from the increased resources and exposure provided by the parallel dissemination efforts spearheaded by 8ra and CISERO.
