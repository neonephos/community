# FAQ

## Are there any plans for meetups or conferences? Will there be a similar engagement model like the CNCF?

We are currently building up the community engagement and outreach strategy. This also includes specific outreach channels to use like Discord or Mastodon. Nevertheless, you can already engage with us by

* attending our [community calls](https://neonephos.org/events/month/)
* attending events which [we also attend](https://neonephos.org/events/month/)

## What influence does the EU have over the foundation since they gave/give money to e.g. ApeiroRA and I see the BMWE-EU funding logo on the project's websites?

The NeoNephos Foundation is part of the Linux Foundation Europe and therefore an independent non-profit organization. Operational decisions are made through the Governing Board where no state-sponsor has a seat with voting power. 
Because ApeiroRA projects (which have been donated to NeoNephos) benefit from state co-financing, we are able to display the BMWE logo in our publications. We see displaying the logo as a privilege and further proof underlining the seriousness of our foundation.

## The NeoNephos Governing Board is predominantly German. Does NeoNephos have a Central European focus?

While only a subset of the 28 EU member countries are actively participating in the IPCEIâ€”CIS, the results produced are applicable to all member states. Moreover, the development of a Multi-Provider-Cloud-Edge-Continuum stands to benefit not just the European Union, but the global community as a whole. There are no national restrictions beyond those [levied upon by the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/navigating-global-regulations-and-open-source-us-ofac-sanctions) for participating in projects, contributing projects or becoming a member of NeoNephos. As long as you, your project, or your organization align with the vision outlined in [our mission statement](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/neonephos-foundation.pdf?__hstc=81619592.b399ecdf5f859a9f55ff3dc8bf8218d5.1748238689615.1750925463455.1750928571631.75&__hssc=81619592.1.1750928571631&__hsfp=1765797706), you are welcome to contribute to our foundation.

## Imagine I have a project and want to donate it to an open-source foundation like the CNCF or NeoNephos. How do I decide which foundation to choose?

This topic deserves its own blog post, which may be published in the future. In brief, while different foundations may share some overlapping areas of interest, they can differ significantly in their mission statements, organizational structures, funding models, members, technical readiness requirements, and more. We encourage you to get fully aquainted with all these areas for each of the foundations you consider. To help you get started finding this information for NeoNephos, you may

## How can my company align with NeoNephos to ensure technical and strategic compatibility?

This topic deserves its own blog post, which may be published in the future. In the meantime, to ensure technical compatibility with NeoNephos, it is recommended to study the projects that require the most interaction with our other initiatives.
One key candidate is [Platform Mesh](https://github.com/platform-mesh), which concerns itself with establishing interoperability between service providers. Additionally, it is also recommended to study key technologies that our projects use like Kubernetes, kcp, Crossplane in addition to more abstract design models like the Kubernetes Resource Model. Our projects therefore follow de-facto cloud-native standards and it would be a good idea if your project does likewise.
