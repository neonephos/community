> The purpose of the NeoNephos Foundation (the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, 
budget and spend funds in support of various open source, open data and/or open 
standards projects relating to the NeoNephos Foundation, as a steward of 
innovation and collaboration. The NeoNephos Foundation is dedicated to 
advancing open-source projects that align with the strategic objectives of the 
European Union's Important Project of Common European Interest in Cloud 
Infrastructure and Services (EU IPCEI-CIS). By fostering a vibrant ecosystem of 
shared technological advancement, the foundation ensures that its initiatives 
complement and extend the pioneering work of the Apeiro Reference Architecture 
(apeirora.eu). The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the 
applicable charter for each Technical Project.
