# NeoNephos Newsletter  July

Hello NeoNephos Newsletter readers! 👋

July has come to a pass. Let’s recap all the important things that happened in July:
 
🛠️ **TAC formed**

On the 18th of July we held the kickoff meeting of our Technical Advisory Council (TAC), officially initiating this very important organizational body. The TAC ensures the technical adherence of the projects to the vision laid out by our Governing Board. The TAC will be spearheaded by the interim chairperson Florian Müller, who will reside in this position for the next three months.

📣 **First NeoNephos Town Hall held**

On July 3rd we held our first townhall, inviting all the foundational members to participate. We got to know each other and discussed the timeline of important roadmap items, like the election of a General Member Governing Board Representative. It was a lively discussion and a lot of great ideas were exchanged.

☁️ **NeoNephos at CloudLand 2025**

In the week starting July 1st we were present at the [CloudLand 2025](https://meine.doag.org/events/cloudland/2025/agenda/#agendaId.5686#eventDay.1751407200) with multiple talks featuring our projects. We outlined our holistic approach to a sovereign stack and encountered genuine interest in our focus areas. We were positively surprised by how many attendees already knew about some of our projects. Recordings can be accessed [here](https://www.cloudland.org/en/archive/cloudland-2025/). It was a great week and we are thankful for the opportunity!
